# Fauxtoshop	
## Basic Infomation
* From [CS106X Assignment 1](http://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106x/cs106x.1162/assignments/hw1-fauxtoshop.pdf)	  
* A photo editor with advanced features like green screen,
“scatter” blur effect, and edge detection.  


## Purposes1. To stress the notion of problem decomposition and taking a thoughtful, organizedapproach to program function and style.2. To become more familiar with C++ strings and console I/O.3. To gain practice with the Grid data structure.4. To evaluate use cases for pass-by-reference parameters vs pass-by-value parameters,including when to use const.

## Progress(60% Done Now)
1. Stucture and two menu levels are finished.
2. Two menu levels left and yet to be rewriten.
3. More detail in [project Kanban](https://github.com/ChingShing/Cpp-Programming-Chowder/projects/1)
