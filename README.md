# C++ Programming Chowder

## Basic Infomation

* The repository includes:	
	* some refined exercises of SJTU SE116 (Authmn 2015)
	* new ones from Standford CS106X/L (Autumn 2015).

	
* Three courses are on C++ Programming so I name it Chowder.

1. Fauxtoshop	 (From [CS106X Assignment 1](http://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106x/cs106x.1162/assignments/hw1-fauxtoshop.pdf)	)  
	* A photo editor with advanced features like green screen,
“scatter” blur effect, and edge detection.  
	* To make use of C++ basics such as Strings and Streams.
2. WordLadder, Two flavors of AI (From [CS106X Assignment 2](http://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106x/cs106x.1162/assignments/hw2-adts.pdf))  
	* A word ladder is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word. 
	* Two flavors of random sentence generator: (1)Statistical Random Sentence Generator; (2)Grammar Rules Random Sentence Generator.
